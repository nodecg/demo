> ðŸš¨ Please note that anyone with the URL to your Glitch will have full control over the NodeCG instance installed on it. To prevent this, you'll need to [make your Glitch private](https://glitch.com/help/privateproject/) **and** observe the [NodeCG security guidelines](https://nodecg.com/tutorial-4_security.html) to set up login security.

> ðŸ’¤ Glitch containers [go to sleep after 5 minutes of inactivity or 12 hours of uptime](https://glitch.com/help/restrictions/), and are therefore not suitable for usage in production. At this time, only use Glitch for demos and tests, and not for running an actual stream.
